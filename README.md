Hi I'm Ethan

I am a Master's in Mathematical Engineering (Mathematics of Finance and Insurance) candidate at Université Côte d’Azur (Nice, France) with a deep passion for applying advanced mathematics, probability theory, and computational techniques to financial markets. My academic and professional background bridges Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Quantitative Finance, equipping me with a strong foundation to design models that address real-world challenges in trading, risk management, and financial engineering.
I am actively seeking Quantitative Research and Quantitative Trading opportunities in Europe for 2026, where I can leverage both my mathematical expertise and hands-on data science experience.


👨‍💻 About Me


🎓 Currently pursuing my Master’s in Mathematical Engineering – Mathematics of Finance and Insurance at Université Côte d’Azur (Class of 2026), where I focus on stochastic calculus, derivative pricing, actuarial mathematics, and quantitative risk modeling.
🧠 Holds an MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science from DSTI – PSL University, and a Double Bachelor in Computer Science & Economics from Université de Paris.

🏦 Experienced as a Data Scientist at Carrefour Banque, where I:

Designed machine learning models for credit risk scoring and product recommendation, improving campaign conversion.
Built R Shiny dashboards to monitor FID-to-Bank client flows, product adoption, and key risk indicators in real time.
Implemented anomaly detection systems on customer identity data, flagging suspicious cases and reinforcing anti-fraud processes.

📊 My previous roles gave me practical expertise in large-scale data processing, predictive modeling, and risk analytics, which I am now channeling into quantitative finance applications.

💡 My core interests include algorithmic trading, quantitative portfolio strategies, risk modeling, time-series forecasting, and the integration of AI into trading systems.



🛠️ My Tech Stack & Skills

Languages: Python, R, SQL, C++
Machine Learning & Data Science: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
Quantitative Finance: Stochastic Calculus, Derivatives Pricing, Actuarial Mathematics, Time-Series Modeling, Monte Carlo Simulation, Optimization
